# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the MVP backend API for the social media sharing system. The UI components are already developed and need simple API endpoints for share count tracking and basic caption generation. This is an MVP implementation focused on core functionality: tracking shares, generating template-based captions, and basic analytics. AI-powered caption generation using OpenAI API will be implemented as the final phase after all core features are working.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Share Count Tracking API

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I need API endpoints to track and retrieve share counts, so that I can display accurate sharing metrics to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/reports/:id/share` THEN the system SHALL increment the share count for the specified report
2. WHEN incrementing share count THEN the system SHALL record the platform used for analytics
3. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/reports/:id` THEN the system SHALL include the current share_count in the response
4. WHEN updating share count THEN the system SHALL validate that the report exists and is not deleted
5. WHEN share tracking fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes and messages
6. IF multiple simultaneous share requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates correctly

### Requirement 2: Database Schema for Share Tracking

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I need proper database schema to store share counts and analytics, so that sharing data is persistent and queryable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the reports table SHALL include a share_count column with default value 0
2. WHEN storing share analytics THEN the system SHALL create a shares table to track individual share events
3. WHEN recording share events THEN the system SHALL store report_id, platform, user_id (if available), and timestamp
4. WHEN querying reports THEN the system SHALL efficiently retrieve share counts without performance impact
5. WHEN share data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity with proper constraints
6. IF database migration is required THEN the system SHALL provide safe migration scripts

### Requirement 3: Template-Based Caption Generation API (MVP)

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I need an API endpoint to generate captions for social media sharing, so that users can share reports with appropriate messaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/reports/:id/generate-caption` THEN the system SHALL return a template-based caption using report data
2. WHEN generating captions THEN the system SHALL accept tone parameter (formal, urgent, community, informative)
3. WHEN generating captions THEN the system SHALL accept platform parameter to optimize for character limits
4. WHEN generating captions THEN the system SHALL use predefined templates with dynamic data insertion
5. WHEN caption generation fails THEN the system SHALL return a basic fallback caption
6. IF invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors

### Requirement 4: Basic Analytics (MVP)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I need basic sharing metrics, so that I can monitor engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN share tracking occurs THEN the system SHALL record basic metrics (report_id, platform, timestamp)
2. WHEN retrieving analytics THEN the system SHALL provide simple aggregated counts by platform
3. WHEN accessing analytics THEN the system SHALL require admin authentication
4. IF no data exists THEN the system SHALL return empty results with appropriate status

### Requirement 5: Basic Security (MVP)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I need basic security measures for sharing APIs, so that the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN share tracking is called THEN the system SHALL validate that the report exists
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens properly
3. WHEN input validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
4. IF invalid report IDs are provided THEN the system SHALL return 404 errors

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing System (MVP)

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I need the sharing APIs to work with the existing report system, so that sharing functionality is integrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN share APIs are called THEN the system SHALL use existing authentication middleware
2. WHEN accessing report data THEN the system SHALL use existing database connection patterns
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use existing error handling systems
4. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL follow existing API response formats

### Requirement 7: AI Caption Generation (Future Phase)

**User Story:** As a system providing advanced caption generation, I need integration with OpenAI API for dynamic caption generation, so that users receive contextually appropriate sharing content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI caption generation is requested THEN the system SHALL integrate with OpenAI API
2. WHEN calling OpenAI THEN the system SHALL include report context (location, category, description)
3. WHEN AI responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize the generated content
4. WHEN AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to templates
5. WHEN AI costs are a concern THEN the system SHALL implement usage tracking and limits
6. IF AI responses are inappropriate THEN the system SHALL filter content and use fallbacks
