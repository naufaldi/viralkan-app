# Geocoding Accuracy Discussion

## Problem with Current Approach

The current free text input approach for address fields (street, district, city, province) has several issues:

### Issues with Free Text Input:

1. **Typos and spelling errors** - "Jakarta" vs "Djakarta" vs "Jakarta Pusat"
2. **Inconsistent naming** - "Jawa Barat" vs "West Java" vs "Jabar"
3. **Missing or incomplete data** - Users might not know exact administrative boundaries
4. **Nominatim failures** - Poor input quality leads to geocoding failures
5. **User confusion** - Users don't know what format to use

### Current Flow Problems:

```
User types: "Jl Sudirman, Jakarta"
→ Nominatim gets: "Jl Sudirman, Jakarta"
→ Result: Might fail or return inaccurate results
```

## Solution Analysis: Multiple Approaches

### **Solution 1: Indonesian Administrative Autocomplete (What I Started)**

**How it works:**

- Cascading dropdowns: Province → City → District → Street
- Pre-defined Indonesian administrative data
- Users select from valid options only

**Pros:**

- ✅ No typos or spelling errors
- ✅ Consistent naming for Nominatim
- ✅ High geocoding success rate
- ✅ User-friendly guided interface
- ✅ Built-in data validation
- ✅ Fast implementation with static data

**Cons:**

- ❌ Limited to pre-defined data only
- ❌ Requires maintaining large dataset
- ❌ Not scalable for all Indonesian locations
- ❌ Static data becomes outdated
- ❌ Heavy initial data setup
- ❌ Users can't enter custom locations

**Best for:** MVP with major cities only

### **Solution 2: Smart Address Autocomplete with Nominatim Search**

**How it works:**

- Real-time search using Nominatim API
- Autocomplete suggestions as user types
- Fallback to manual input if no matches

**Pros:**

- ✅ Covers all Indonesian locations
- ✅ Always up-to-date data
- ✅ No data maintenance required
- ✅ Handles edge cases and new locations
- ✅ Users can still enter custom addresses

## **Street-Level Data Challenge**

### **The Street Problem:**

- **No API for Indonesian streets** - Unlike provinces/cities/districts
- **Street data is massive** - Millions of streets across Indonesia
- **Dynamic and changing** - New streets, name changes, etc.
- **Inconsistent naming** - "Jl. Sudirman" vs "Jalan Sudirman" vs "Sudirman"

### **Street Data Solutions:**

#### **Option A: Nominatim Street Search (Recommended)**

**How it works:**

- Use Nominatim's search API for street suggestions
- Search within selected district/city
- Real-time street suggestions as user types

**Pros:**

- ✅ Covers all Indonesian streets
- ✅ Always up-to-date
- ✅ No data maintenance
- ✅ Handles new streets automatically
- ✅ Free to use

**Cons:**

- ❌ Rate limited (1 request/second)
- ❌ Slower than static data
- ❌ Network dependency
- ❌ Quality varies by location

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Search streets in selected district
const searchStreets = async (query: string, districtId: string) => {
  const district = getDistrictById(districtId);
  const searchQuery = `${query}, ${district.name}, Indonesia`;

  return await nominatimSearch(searchQuery);
};
```

#### **Option B: OpenStreetMap Overpass API**

**How it works:**

- Query OpenStreetMap directly for street data
- More detailed street information
- Better filtering options

**Pros:**

- ✅ More detailed street data
- ✅ Better filtering (by district, road type, etc.)
- ✅ Includes road metadata (type, surface, etc.)
- ✅ Free to use

**Cons:**

- ❌ More complex queries
- ❌ Rate limited
- ❌ Requires understanding of OSM data structure
- ❌ Slower than Nominatim

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Overpass query for streets in district
const overpassQuery = `
  [out:json][timeout:25];
  area["name:en"="${districtName}"]["admin_level"="8"]->.district;
  way["highway"]["name"~"${query}"](area.district);
  out body;
  >;
  out skel qt;
`;
```

#### **Option C: Hybrid Street Approach (Best)**

**How it works:**

- Static data for major streets in major cities
- Nominatim search for other streets
- Cache successful street searches

**Pros:**

- ✅ Fast for common streets
- ✅ Full coverage for all streets
- ✅ Reduces API calls
- ✅ Best user experience

**Cons:**

- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Requires street data maintenance

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface StreetSearch {
  // Static data for major streets
  staticStreets: StreetData[];

  // Nominatim search for other streets
  nominatimSearch: (query: string, district: string) => Promise<Street[]>;

  // Cache for performance
  streetCache: Map<string, Street[]>;
}

// Usage:
1. User types street name → Check static data first
2. If found → Return immediately (fast)
3. If not found → Search Nominatim
4. Cache results for future use
```

#### **Option D: Manual Street Input with Validation**

**How it works:**

- Users type street names manually
- Basic validation (not empty, reasonable length)
- Let Nominatim handle the geocoding

**Pros:**

- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ No street data maintenance
- ✅ Users can enter any street name
- ✅ Works for all locations

**Cons:**

- ❌ No autocomplete/validation
- ❌ Users can make typos
- ❌ Lower geocoding success rate
- ❌ Poor user experience

## **My Recommendation: Hybrid Street Approach (Option C)**

### **Why Hybrid Street is Best:**

1. **Optimal User Experience:**
   - Fast autocomplete for major streets (80% of use cases)
   - Full coverage for all other streets
   - No dead ends

2. **Practical Implementation:**
   - Start with major streets in major cities
   - Expand coverage over time
   - Manageable data maintenance

3. **Cost Effective:**
   - Minimal API calls through caching
   - Static data for common streets
   - Predictable performance

### **Street Data Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Major Streets Only (MVP)**

- Jakarta: Jl. Sudirman, Jl. Thamrin, Jl. Gatot Subroto, etc.
- Bandung: Jl. Asia Afrika, Jl. Braga, Jl. Dago, etc.
- Surabaya: Jl. Tunjungan, Jl. Basuki Rahmat, etc.
- ~100-200 major streets total

**Phase 2: Add Nominatim Street Search**

- For streets not in static data
- Cached results for performance
- Fallback for all other streets

**Phase 3: Expand Static Data**

- Add more streets based on user feedback
- Focus on high-traffic areas
- Community-driven expansion

### **Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
interface StreetAutocomplete {
  // Static data for major streets
  staticStreets: Map<string, Street[]>; // districtId -> streets

  // Nominatim search for other streets
  searchStreets: (query: string, district: District) => Promise<Street[]>;

  // Cache for performance
  streetCache: Map<string, Street[]>;

  // Fallback to manual input
  manualInput: () => void;
}

// Usage flow:
1. User selects district → Load static streets for that district
2. User types street name → Filter static streets first
3. If found → Show suggestions immediately (fast)
4. If not found → Search Nominatim
5. Cache successful searches for future use
6. Allow manual input as last resort
```

### **Expected Results:**

- **< 200ms response time** for major streets
- **< 1s response time** for all streets
- **90%+ street autocomplete coverage** for major cities
- **100% coverage** through Nominatim fallback
- **Significantly better user experience**

This approach gives you the best balance of speed, coverage, and maintainability for street-level data.
