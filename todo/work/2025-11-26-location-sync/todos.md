- location-sync-research (completed): Trace current-location geocoding to administrative select flow; identified missing parent codes when caching dynamic options causing values to be stored under undefined keys.
- location-sync-fix (in_progress): Implement fixes to set/admin-sync codes+names and ensure combobox options display selected values after geolocation (added ISO province fallback mapping).
- location-sync-validate (pending): Run lint/tests as appropriate and manual current-location flow to confirm selects auto-fill and remain editable.
