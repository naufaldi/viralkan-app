# TODO - Form Validation Issues

## Problem: Form Fields Show Red Borders Even When Values Are Present

### Issue Description

- Form fields in `report-form-fields.tsx` and `administrative-select.tsx` display red borders and validation errors even when they contain valid values
- Specifically affects: "Nama Jalan", "Kabupaten/Kota", and "Kecamatan" fields
- Error messages like "Street name is required", "City is required", "District is required" appear despite fields having values

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Form Validation Not Triggered**: When administrative values are selected programmatically via `form.setValue()`, the form validation is not being triggered properly
2. **Missing Validation Trigger**: The `form.setValue()` calls in `administrative-select.tsx` don't include the `shouldValidate: true` option
3. **Timing Issue**: Form validation runs before the values are properly set, causing persistent error states

### Technical Details

- Form uses `react-hook-form` with `zodResolver` and `mode: "onChange"`
- Required fields in schema: `street_name`, `city`, `district`, `province`
- Administrative select sets both code and name fields: `province_code`/`province`, `regency_code`/`city`, `district_code`/`district`

### Solution

1. **Update form.setValue() calls** in `administrative-select.tsx` to include `shouldValidate: true`
2. **Trigger immediate validation** after setting values to clear error states
3. **Ensure proper field mapping** between form schema and component field names

### Files to Modify

- `apps/web/components/reports/administrative-select.tsx` - Update form.setValue() calls
- `apps/web/components/reports/report-form/report-form-fields.tsx` - Verify field validation

### Implementation Steps

1. Add `shouldValidate: true` to all `form.setValue()` calls in administrative-select.tsx
2. Test form validation behavior after administrative selections
3. Verify error states are cleared when valid values are present
4. Ensure form submission works correctly with validated data

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Select administrative values and verify red borders disappear
- [x] Check that error messages are cleared when fields have values
- [x] Verify form submission works with all required fields filled
- [x] Test edge cases: clearing fields, switching between options

### ✅ Fix Applied

**Files Modified:**

1. `apps/web/components/reports/administrative-select.tsx` - Added `shouldValidate: true` to all `form.setValue()` calls
2. `apps/web/components/reports/edit-report-form.tsx` - Added `shouldValidate: true` to coordinate setting
3. `apps/web/components/reports/administrative-sync-demo.tsx` - Added `shouldValidate: true` to street_name setting
4. `apps/web/components/reports/report-form/use-report-form.ts` - Added `shouldValidate: true` to all form.setValue() calls

**Changes Made:**

- Updated all `form.setValue()` calls to include `{ shouldValidate: true }` option
- This triggers immediate form validation after values are set programmatically
- Ensures error states are cleared when valid values are present
- Fixes the red border issue where fields showed validation errors despite having values
- **Specifically fixed street_name field** that was still showing errors

**Key Fixes:**

- **Street Name Field**: Fixed in `use-report-form.ts` where geocoding sets street_name programmatically
- **Administrative Fields**: Fixed in `administrative-select.tsx` for province/regency/district selections
- **Coordinate Fields**: Fixed in multiple files for lat/lon setting
- **Demo Component**: Fixed in `administrative-sync-demo.tsx` for testing scenarios

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ Form fields should no longer show red borders when they contain valid values
- ✅ Error messages should be cleared immediately when administrative values are selected
- ✅ Form validation should work correctly for both manual input and programmatic value setting
- ✅ **Street name field should now work correctly** when values are set via geocoding or manual input
