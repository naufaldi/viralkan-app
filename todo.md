# GeoJSON & GIS Implementation Todo

## Current Task

- [ ] Implement EXIF extraction service to parse GPS coordinates from uploaded images

## High Priority (Core GIS Infrastructure)

- [x] âœ… Research existing codebase and GIS RFC requirements
- [x] âœ… Create database migration for administrative boundary fields (kecamatan, kota, provinsi, country, geocoded_at, geocoding_source)
- [x] âœ… Install required dependencies: exifr (EXIF extraction), leaflet (mapping), redis (caching)
- [ ] Implement EXIF extraction service to parse GPS coordinates from uploaded images
- [ ] Implement Nominatim geocoding service with rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Create geocoding API endpoints: /api/geocoding/extract-exif, /api/geocoding/reverse, /api/geocoding/forward

## Medium Priority (Frontend Integration)

- [ ] Create GeoJSON API endpoint: GET /api/reports/geojson with filtering capabilities
- [ ] Enhance report creation form with EXIF extraction and auto-fill from geocoding
- [ ] Create Leaflet map components for report visualization
- [ ] Integrate map components into public reports page and report detail pages

## Low Priority (Testing & Quality)

- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for geocoding services, EXIF extraction, and GeoJSON endpoints
- [ ] Run lint, format, and test commands to ensure code quality

## Completed âœ…

- [x] Research existing codebase structure and GIS RFC requirements
- [x] Understand current location functionality (GPS button, coordinate storage)
- [x] Verify PostGIS and spatial indexing already implemented
- [x] Document current gaps and implementation readiness
- [x] Create database migration 006_add_gis_administrative_boundaries.sql
- [x] Run database migration successfully - added kecamatan, kota, provinsi, country, geocoded_at, geocoding_source fields
- [x] Install exifr@7.1.3 for EXIF metadata extraction (API)
- [x] Install leaflet@1.9.4 and @types/leaflet@1.9.20 for mapping (Web)
- [x] Install react-leaflet@5.0.0 for React integration (Web)
- [x] Install redis@5.6.1 for geocoding cache (API)
- [x] Verify API tests still passing (8/8 tests pass)

## Implementation Progress

**âœ… Infrastructure Ready:**

- Database schema enhanced with administrative boundaries
- All required dependencies installed
- PostGIS spatial indexing already configured
- Clean architecture ready for new services

**ðŸ”„ Next Steps:**

- Implement EXIF extraction service per RFC specification
- Add Nominatim geocoding with rate limiting
- Create geocoding API endpoints
- Build GeoJSON response format
- Enhance frontend forms with auto-fill
- Add map visualization components

## Notes

- Database migration adds indexes for performant administrative boundary queries
- Dependencies installed follow RFC technical specifications exactly
- Current GPS location button provides good foundation to build upon
- Clean 4-layer architecture makes service addition straightforward
