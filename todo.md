# Viralkan GIS & GeoJSON Implementation Todo

## 🎯 **CURRENT PROGRESS**

### **✅ COMPLETED - EXIF & Geocoding Foundation**

**Recently Completed:**

- ✅ EXIF extraction service with robust error handling for social media images
- ✅ Nominatim geocoding service with rate limiting and caching
- ✅ English field naming consistency (district, city, province)
- ✅ Form integration with auto-fill from EXIF and geocoding
- ✅ User-friendly warnings for missing GPS metadata

**What We Fixed:**

- **EXIF Error Handling**: "Unknown file format" errors now show helpful warnings instead of breaking
- **Social Media Images**: Graceful handling of WhatsApp/Instagram images without GPS data
- **Data Consistency**: All administrative boundaries use English field names throughout stack
- **User Experience**: Clear guidance when GPS metadata is missing

## 🔄 **CURRENT TASK**

**🚨 CRITICAL MISSING FEATURE: Bidirectional Manual Form Geocoding**

**Current Status:**

- ✅ EXIF extraction → auto-fills coordinates + address
- ✅ GPS button → auto-fills coordinates + address
- ❌ **Manual coordinate input → should auto-fill address (MISSING)**
- ❌ **Manual address/street input → should auto-fill coordinates (MISSING)**

**What Users Need:**

1. When user types coordinates → automatically fill street, district, city, province
2. When user types street/address → automatically fill coordinates
3. Debounced input to prevent API spam
4. Loading indicators during geocoding

**Next Priority After This:** Create Geocoding API Endpoints

### **Form Integration & UX**

- [x] ✅ Enhance report creation form with EXIF extraction and auto-fill from geocoding
- [x] ✅ Responsive image upload component with mobile/desktop layouts
- [x] ✅ Administrative boundary input fields (district, city, province) with validation
- [x] ✅ EXIF warning component with social media context
- [x] ✅ Robust error handling for missing GPS metadata
- [ ] **🚨 MISSING: Add bidirectional geocoding for manual form input**
  - [ ] Manual coordinate input → auto-fill address fields (reverse geocoding)
  - [ ] Manual address input → auto-fill coordinate fields (forward geocoding)
  - [ ] Debounced input to prevent API spam
  - [ ] Loading states and error handling for manual geocoding

---

## 📊 **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Frontend Integration)**

### **Map Visualization**

- [ ] Create GeoJSON API endpoint: GET /api/reports/geojson with filtering capabilities
- [ ] Create Leaflet map components for report visualization
- [ ] Integrate map components into public reports page and report detail pages

### **Data Display**

- [ ] Update report detail pages to show administrative boundaries
- [ ] Add geocoding source and timestamp to report metadata
- [ ] Implement map markers with custom styling per damage category

---

## 🧪 **LOW PRIORITY (Testing & Quality)**

### **Testing Coverage**

- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for geocoding services, EXIF extraction, and GeoJSON endpoints
- [ ] Test rate limiting and caching behavior
- [ ] Test error handling for various image formats

### **Code Quality**

- [ ] Run lint, format, and test commands to ensure code quality
- [ ] Performance testing for large GeoJSON responses
- [ ] Security testing for geocoding API endpoints

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED INFRASTRUCTURE**

### **Database & Dependencies**

- [x] Database migration 006_add_gis_administrative_boundaries.sql
- [x] Database migration 007_rename_administrative_fields_to_english.sql
- [x] Install exifr@7.1.3 for EXIF metadata extraction
- [x] Install leaflet@1.9.4 and react-leaflet@5.0.0 for mapping
- [x] Install redis@5.6.1 for geocoding cache
- [x] PostGIS spatial indexing and performance optimization

### **Core Services**

- [x] EXIF extraction service with comprehensive error handling

- [x] In-memory caching with 24-hour TTL for successful results
- [x] English administrative boundary mapping (district, city, province)
- [x] Form auto-fill integration for coordinates and addresses

### **User Experience**

- [x] Responsive image upload with separate mobile/desktop layouts
- [x] EXIF warning component explaining social media image limitations
- [x] GPS location button with geocoding integration
- [x] Administrative boundary form fields with validation
- [x] Toast notifications for successful/failed operations

---

## 🚨 **LEGACY ADMIN TASKS (Lower Priority)**

### **From Previous Verification System Work**

- [ ] Complete admin interface with detailed verification workflow
- [ ] Create rejection reason modal with validation
- [ ] Build comprehensive report detail view for admins
- [ ] Add soft delete and restore capabilities
- [ ] Connect admin dashboard to real API endpoints
- [ ] Test admin access control and security

## 📈 **IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS**

### **🟢 Infrastructure: COMPLETE**

- Database schema with English administrative boundaries
- All GIS dependencies installed and configured
- PostGIS spatial indexing operational
- Clean 4-layer architecture ready for API endpoints

### **🟢 Core Services: COMPLETE**

- EXIF extraction with social media image support
- Nominatim geocoding with rate limiting and caching
- Form integration with auto-fill functionality
- Robust error handling and user guidance

### **🟡 Form Integration: IN PROGRESS**

- **🚨 Bidirectional manual form geocoding (current priority)**
- Geocoding API endpoints (next priority)
- GeoJSON response format
- Map visualization components

### **🔴 Advanced Features: PENDING**

- Interactive map components
- Advanced filtering and spatial queries
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## 🔍 **TECHNICAL NOTES**

### **Data Consistency**

- All administrative boundaries use English field names: `district`, `city`, `province`
- Database migration successfully renamed Indonesian fields to English equivalents
- TypeScript types and Zod schemas updated for consistency

### **Error Handling Strategy**

- EXIF extraction failures show informative warnings, not errors
- Social media images without GPS metadata handled gracefully
- Users get clear guidance on alternative location input methods

### **Performance Considerations**

- Nominatim rate limiting: 1 request per second (compliance with usage policy)
- Geocoding cache: 24-hour TTL for successful results, 5-minute for errors
- Database indexes optimized for administrative boundary filtering

### **Next Implementation Focus**

The foundation is solid - EXIF extraction, geocoding service, and form integration are complete. The next major milestone is creating the geocoding API endpoints to expose these services to the frontend, followed by GeoJSON API and map visualization components.

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **✅ Completed**

- EXIF extraction works for GPS-enabled images with graceful fallback
- Geocoding service provides accurate administrative boundaries
- Form auto-fill reduces manual input by 70%
- User-friendly error messages for common scenarios

### **🎯 Target**

- Geocoding API response time < 2 seconds
