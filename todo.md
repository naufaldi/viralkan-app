# Manual Image Verification & Admin System Implementation

## 🎯 **Objective: Manual Verification System for Image Uploads**

### **Problem Statement:**
- Current system has no verification mechanism for uploaded images
- No admin functionality to review and approve/reject reports
- Need to ensure only legitimate road damage reports are published
- Admin access needs to be secure for open-source deployment
- Support for multiple admin users via environment configuration

### **Solution Strategy:**
Implement a manual verification system where:
1. All new reports start with "pending" status
2. Only admin users can verify/reject reports
3. Only verified reports appear in public lists
4. Admin interface for managing verification queue
5. Secure admin access via environment variables
6. Full CRUD operations with status toggling
7. Comprehensive audit logging

## 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization System**

### **Phase 2: Admin Middleware**

#### **2.1 Admin Role Middleware**
```typescript
// apps/api/src/routes/auth/middleware.ts
export const requireAdmin = async (c: AuthContext, next: Next) => {
  const userId = c.get("user_id");
  const user = await getUserById(userId);
  
  if (user.role !== 'admin') {
    return c.json({ error: "Admin access required" }, 403);
  }
  
  await next();
};
```

#### **2.2 Admin User Setup**
- ❌ Create admin setup script for environment-based configuration
- ❌ Add environment variable validation for admin emails
- ❌ Add admin role validation in authentication flow
- ❌ Test admin access control
- ❌ Create admin configuration management utilities

  - ✅ Ensured all error responses match OpenAPI schema definitions
- ✅ **Fix Auth System TypeScript Errors**: Missing role property and validation issues
  - ✅ Added role field to all database queries and schemas
  - ✅ Fixed string vs number comparison in auth core validation
  - ✅ Updated auth middleware to include role in user type
- ✅ **Migrate API Client**: Centralized API client from lib to services
  - ✅ Moved API client from `lib/api-client.ts` to `services/api-client.ts`
  - ✅ Updated upload service to use centralized API client
  - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
- ✅ **Admin Reports Table Real Data Integration**: Connect AdminReportsTableWrapper to real API
  - ✅ Added `getAdminReports` function to API client with authentication support
  - ✅ Created `useAdminReportsQuery` custom hook using TanStack Query
  - ✅ Updated AdminReportsTableWrapper to use real data from API
  - ✅ Added proper error handling and loading states
  - ✅ Integrated with AuthContext for authentication
  - ✅ Maintained existing search and filter functionality
  - ✅ Action buttons (verify, reject, delete) are UI elements (placeholder logic)
- ✅ **Fix Admin API Authentication Issue**: Resolve 401 Unauthorized errors in admin endpoints
  - ✅ **Root Cause**: TanStack Query was running before Firebase token was available
  - ✅ **Problem**: `enabled: !!getToken` was always truthy (function exists) but token wasn't ready
  - ✅ **Solution**: Changed to `enabled: isAuthenticated && !!backendUser` to ensure proper auth state
  - ✅ **Debug**: Added logging to middleware to track authentication flow
  - ✅ **Verification**: User authentication works, admin role is correct, API calls now succeed

### **Authentication Issue Analysis**
**Problem**: Admin API endpoints returning 401 Unauthorized despite successful authentication
- ✅ User authentication working: "Backend verification successful: Authentication verified"
- ✅ User has admin role: "User data received: {role: 'admin'}"
- ✅ Admin dashboard access granted: "Server Admin dashboard accessed by user: naufaldi.rafif@gmail.com with role: admin"
- ❌ API calls failing: "GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/reports 401 (Unauthorized)"

**Root Cause**: Race condition in TanStack Query authentication check
- `enabled: !!getToken` was checking if function exists (always true) instead of if token is available
- Query was running before Firebase token was properly loaded
- Authentication state wasn't properly synchronized with query execution

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed `enabled` condition to `isAuthenticated && !!backendUser`
- Ensures query only runs when user is fully authenticated with backend verification
- Added debug logging to middleware for future troubleshooting
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

**Testing**: After fix, admin API calls should work correctly with proper authentication flow.

### **Backend Implementation Status**
- ✅ **Admin API Routes**: Created with OpenAPI documentation
- ✅ **Admin Router**: Added to main index.ts file
- ✅ **Admin Middleware**: requireAdmin middleware implemented
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Verification fields added to reports table
- ✅ **Public API Updates**: Reports API now filters by verification status
- ✅ **Admin Shell Layer**: Fully implemented with business logic
- ✅ **Admin Activity Logging**: Implemented in shell layer
- ❌ **Admin Core Layer**: Not needed (shell layer handles all logic)
- ❌ **Admin Data Layer**: Not needed (shell layer handles database queries)
