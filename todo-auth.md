## üéØ NEW TASK: Header Authentication UI Enhancement

### Current Status

Authentication system is COMPLETE and WORKING. The task now is to enhance the header UI to reflect authentication states.

### ‚úÖ What's Already Working

- Complete Firebase + PostgreSQL authentication flow
- useAuth hook with comprehensive auth state management
- AuthContext already integrated in app layout
- Professional login form with error handling

### üîß Header Enhancement Plan

#### Phase 1: Update Header Component ‚ú® PRIORITY TASK

- [ ] **Import useAuthContext in header component**
- [ ] **Replace static "Mulai Lapor" button with conditional rendering:**
  - **Unauthenticated state**: Show "Mulai Lapor" button ‚Üí redirects to `/login`
  - **Authenticated state**: Show user profile dropdown with:
    - User avatar/name display
    - "Dashboard" link ‚Üí `/dashboard` (new route)
    - "Buat Laporan" link ‚Üí `/laporan/buat` (authenticated report creation)
    - "Keluar" (Logout) option

#### Phase 2: Create Dashboard Route

- [ ] **Create `/dashboard` route** - accessible only when authenticated
- [ ] **Basic dashboard page** showing user info and reports. Contain how much user create report, grid or list laporan that can show report user already created. use docs/ui-concept.md and docs/design-1.png as reference
- [ ] **Protected route middleware** for dashboard access

#### Phase 3: Enhanced UX

- [ ] **Loading states** during authentication verification
- [ ] **Mobile responsive** auth UI in header
- [ ] **User avatar integration** from Firebase profile
- [ ] **Smooth transitions** between auth states

### üöÄ Implementation Details

#### Header Auth States to Handle:

```typescript
const {
  isAuthenticated, // Show login vs logout state
  isLoading, // Loading state during auth
  backendUser, // User profile data (name, avatar, email)
  signOut, // Logout function
  authError, // Error handling
} = useAuthContext();
```

#### Conditional Button Logic:

```typescript
// Unauthenticated: "Mulai Lapor" ‚Üí /login
// Authenticated: User dropdown with Dashboard, Create Report, Logout
```

#### New Routes Needed:

- `/dashboard` - User dashboard (protected)
- `/laporan/buat` - Create new report (protected)

### üé® UI/UX Requirements

- **Consistent styling** with existing header design
- **Smooth transitions** between auth states
- **Mobile-friendly** dropdown/menu
- **Loading indicators** during auth state changes
- **Error handling** for auth failures

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] Header shows "Mulai Lapor" button when not authenticated
- [ ] Header shows user profile dropdown when authenticated
- [ ] Dashboard button only visible to authenticated users
- [ ] Dashboard route works and is protected
- [ ] Logout functionality works correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained

### üîç Files to Modify

1. **`apps/web/components/layout/header.tsx`** - Main header component
2. **`apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`** - New dashboard route (create)
3. **`apps/web/app/laporan/buat/page.tsx`** - Protected report creation (optional)

### ‚ö° Ready to Implement

All authentication infrastructure is ready. This is purely UI enhancement work using existing auth context and state management.

## Previous Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Already Implemented (No Work Needed)

- Complete Firebase + PostgreSQL authentication system
- Frontend-backend integration working
- Database user management operational
- Protected routes middleware functional

### ‚úÖ Next Steps (Previous Plan - COMPLETED)

1. ‚úÖ **Test existing implementation** - Authentication system confirmed working
2. ‚úÖ **Frontend API integration** - useAuth hook handles complete flow
3. ‚úÖ **Database records verified** - PostgreSQL user storage working
4. ‚úÖ **Protected routes tested** - Middleware authentication operational

The authentication system is production-ready and the new focus is enhancing the header UI for better user experience!
